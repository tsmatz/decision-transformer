# Decision Transformer Examples

Transformer is today's scalable proven architecture, and this architecture is sometimes used for autoregressive sequential modeling (such as, time-series analysis) by leveraging causally masked Transformers.<br>
Decision Transformer is an offline reinforcement learning algorithm also based on autoregressive sequential modeling, which simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer.

This repository shows you the implementation of Decision Transformer, using examples.
